## Fun Facts 🎉

- My first program was a humble “Hello World” in Python 🐍 (shocking, right?).
- Soon after, I fell in love with HTML (yes, I know it’s not a programming language 😆), CSS, and JavaScript.
- I’ve been learning ever since — and I’m still on the journey, because in tech, the learning never stops.

**Bonus Round:** Let’s settle the timeless debate — Tabs or Spaces? (Spoiler: Tabs all the way 😉).
