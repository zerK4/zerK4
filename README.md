# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub abode, where code dances with creativity and bugs fear to tread. I'm a full-stack developer with a passionate crush on Next.js and TypeScript (psst, don't tell anyone but I kinda like also the purple elefant 🤫). If you're here for some severe code craftsmanship sprinkled with humor, you've landed in the proper byte-sized paradise.

## About Me 🤓

I'm the architect behind the screen, turning caffeine into elegant code and bugs into features. Armed with a penchant for translating tangled problems into elegant solutions, I'm all ears for challenges. Be it sculpting user interfaces or untangling backend enigmas, I've got your back(end).

## My Superpowers 🦸‍♂️

- 🚀 Full-stack wizardry: Navigating both the front-end labyrinth and the back-end wilderness.
- 💻 Next.js whisperer: Fluent in Next.js - it's practically my native language(kinda).
- 📜 TypeScript sorcerer: I wield the magic of solid typing to tame chaos.
- 🛍️ Magento spellbinder: Hated it at the beginning but I can say that it's pretty nice after all.
- 🏰 AEM thing: Gosh, this might be hard to learn after all :grimacing:.

## Fun Facts 🎉

- My first program was a "Hello World" (cool ya? bet you "didn't do the same") in Python 🖤, a few years back.
- I realized shortly that I did not like Python so much and I jumped on HTML(not a programming language 😆), CSS, and JS, where I fell in love ❤️.
- Little by little I started learning, and I learned and learned until I got here (obviously I'm currently still learning new things but who doesn't).

## Let's Collab! 🌐

If your passion for code burns as brightly as mine, let's team up and conjure wonders. Reach out to me whether you seek collaboration, yearn for coding quips, or wish to engage in the timeless tabs-vs-spaces debate (spoiler: tabs all the way ☺️).

Remember, the finest code is woven with whimsy and determination. Happy coding! 🎈
